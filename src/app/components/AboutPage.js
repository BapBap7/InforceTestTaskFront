    return (
        <div>
            So this should be a pretty AboutUsPage but unfortunately i didnt have enough time to finish this, so it will be a plain text <br/>
            It was a really great test task, i found couple of my weaknesses that i should improve <br/>
            <h2>About Algorithm</h2>
            This is a really simple algorithm, kinda works like HashMap. <br/>
            I just create a simple random hash, and link to that hash my long url <br/>
            So when you go by the shortened url it will just look at the code, check the hashmap and redirect you to a long link
        </div>
    );
}

export default AboutPage;
